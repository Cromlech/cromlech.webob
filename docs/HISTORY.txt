  environ. It's done in the method `application_url` of the request.

  This change is not backward compatible.

  non declated attributes. Tested accordingly.

0.4 (2012-01-24)
----------------

- Added redirection handling as a multiadapter, to match the changes made
  in `cromlech.dawnlight`. The multiadapter's module must be grokked by
  hand, it won't be done for you if you include this package.
